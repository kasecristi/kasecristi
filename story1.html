WHO
<br>
You are an outsider to this situation. You were outside on your 5 am sharp hike as dawn approaches you notice some people. <br> WHO are they? You did not want to interrupt; in fact you did not really feel like saying anything small like "Hello" or "Good Morning" and walk on by. Instead, you just went on with your own business. They laugh and banter  in the background. 
<br>
Have you ever sat in a restaurant and guess who people are? 
<br>
We all have. In fact, as you start to walk away you create a story of WHO they are.

She does not look so happy, maybe because John invited his "boys." Anderson and Michael came along ready with a pack of White Claw.It looks like they plan to camp here...  </p>

Sometimes as humans we assume things first before we discover WHO someone is.
