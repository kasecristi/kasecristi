So imagine this, you're on a date... and in attempt to get to know this person, you say "WHAT do you do?" Did you know that is a common topic to get to know someone. While it is a valid question to ask what one may do for a living... it is a shallow attempt to get to know someone.

WHAT. 
Gives us context into the stories that people carry. Now instead of "WHAT do you do?" Replace it with "WHAT are you passionate about?" Once you do that, well you've got your foot in the door. You have access to who a person is.The "WHAT" plays a big part into the "Who." This is a better question to get to know the person in front of you because you're not just asking how a person makes money, but rather what keeps them going and what makes life worth living for them. 

WHAT is an interesting story, so listen carefully.
