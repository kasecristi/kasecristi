<h1>WHERE</h1>
<a href="story2.html">Back to "WHAT"</a>
<p>With every good story is a setting. WHERE we find ourselves in this moment is part of our story. WHERE we are and WHERE we have been plays a role into who we are a person. 
So if you could be anywhere now WHERE would it be?
Are you there?
If not then why aren't you?</p>
