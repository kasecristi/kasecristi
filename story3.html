<p>Every good story has a setting. WHERE we find ourselves in this moment... is part of our story. WHERE we are and WHERE we have been play a role into who we are as a person. 
So if you could be anywhere right now WHERE would it be?
Are you there?
If not, then why aren't you?
As much as it is personally important to yourself; it is the same thing for the person you know nothing about.</p>
